      They're are mostly over 1,500 species that are unknown today. Overtime the moon jellyfish has been able adapt to climate tempature 
      allocation and have also developed toxins in there body to help protect them from predators nearby.Moon jellies mostly spend there 
      time drifting through the waters. They use the wind and current to take from place to place. If stung by a jelly like this one, 
      some swelling may occur and redness but nothing fatal. Moon jellies mostly consume various types of mollusks and plankton. They
