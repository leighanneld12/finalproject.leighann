 <p> The Portugese Man O' War is found on the surface in the Alantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. The Portugese Man O' War is a a marine hydrozoan
  filled with a family of physaliidae floating around in the water. If touched with its tentacles it will deliver a painful sting powerful
  enough to kill other fish or humans, but that is a very rare occurance nowadays.They are able to still stink you weeks after being on land. Using its tentacles will sting and killing small fish and
    crustaceans.  People confuse the animal as being a jellyfish but it is clearly not. It is not actually a multicelluar organism, but a colonial organism that is made up of specialized,individual animals,
  (of the same species) zooids and polyps. They stick togather because they cannot independently survive on there own. Therefore they have
  to work togather to function like an individual animal. As this animal floats, it moves according to the winds, currents, and tides. They
   are sometimes most commonly found in open ocean of tropical or subtropical regions. They are also known to wash up on shore sometimes on 
    beaches.</p>
