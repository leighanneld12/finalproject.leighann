  <h1> The Box Jellyfish </h1>
  <strong> <p> A boxjellyfish is a cndarian invertabrate distinguished by there cube-shaped medusae. 
    It's name is common for any'radially symetrical' marine invertabrates.This jellyfish is one of 
    the most dangerous creatures in the world and will deliver a painful sting if been touched. Box jellies
    are most common in tropical waters such as Vietnam, Hawaii, Northern Austrailia, and the Philippines. The nematocyst
    is its special line of offense or defense and function by a chemical trigger that causes a specialized cell
    to eject a barb or poisioned hook that stick into. It will then ensnare, or entangle prey or predators, killing
    or atleast paralyzing its victim. Box jellyfish are predators and are known to eat fish, crustatcean arthropods,
    and worms. It will wrap its tentacles around the prey, enjecting the venom pulling it into the 'bell' of the animal
    and engulf it into the mouth. This animal has made over 5,567 deaths recorded since 1954. Not all 'box jellies' are
    this dangerous to humans. During the winter months, studies show that they sleep on the ocean floor around 3:00am to conserve energy
    and avoid predators. </p> </strong>
