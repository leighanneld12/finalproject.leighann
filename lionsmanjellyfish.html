  <h1> The Lion's Mane Jellyfish </h1>
  <p> This jellyfish has a bell diameter of 7 feet wide and 190 feet long tentacles, it would be very easy to spot out in the ocean. 
    The Lion's Mane jellyfish gets its name from is 'mane' being long, and hair-like tentacles is the inspiration to the common lion's 
    mane we see  today. Most lion's mane jellyfish live in the Artic and North Pacific ocean from Alaska to Washington where the waters
    are fairly cool. It also harbors a powerful sting to catch its prey. It mostly preys on small fishes,tiny crustaceans and other jellyfish
    to satify its taste. These jellyfish are continual swimmers and can obtain great distances involving the currents. They sometimes travel
    in hurdles but thats only when rip tides and strong currents occur. They normally float solo. Lion's mane jellies start to breed early 
    March-May via external fertilization. The polyp will settle and within 30-40 days they will transform into jellies.
